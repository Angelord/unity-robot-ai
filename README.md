# Mr Roboto

## About
This was developed as a university project for an AI course. The program models a robot AI that has to push a box to its 
destination, avoiding pathing blockers along the way.

The project was developed in C#. Although it uses the Unity game engine for visualization, the AI logic is entirely self-contained
and can be found in the namespace "MrRoboto.GameLogic".

## How to Build
The project was developed in Unity version 2017.4.18f1, but should also be compatible with newer versions. 

Follow these steps to build :
  1) Start-up Unity and load the project. If you're using a newer version you'll have to wait for the files to be upgraded.
  3) Once the project is loaded, go to [File->Build Settings] and select a target platform. 
  4) Click build and choose a destination. 

## Controls
These are also listed in the application itself. 

* Drag with the Left Mouse Button to add and remove pathing blocks. 

* Right-Click on a tile to place the Cargo on it. 

* Holding [G] while Right-Clicking on a tile will move the Goal to it. 

* Eplore First : If this option is enabled, the robot will explore the entire grid before attempting to push the cargo.

* Use [-] and [+] while the simulation is running to increase and decrease its speed.
